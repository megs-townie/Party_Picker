Exercise 8 for Intro to OOP

This exercise was done to introduce the class to the GUI elements of Java while also practicing inheritence.
It allows a user to input names of guests, food items they will be bringing and if that guest is invited or not.
Users can add as many guests as they would like and once all guests are added it will display a report on the guests what they want to bring
and if they are invited.
