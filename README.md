# Party Guest List Manager

## Overview

This Java application is designed to manage a guest list for a party. It utilizes `JOptionPane` from the `javax.swing` package to interact with the user through a graphical interface. Users can add guests to the list, specify the food items they will bring, and indicate whether they are invited to the party.

## Features

- **Add Guests**: Add guests to the party list with their names and the food they will bring.
- **Invitation Status**: Specify whether each guest is invited to the party.
- **Guest List Review**: Review the final list of all added guests with their details.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or a simple text editor.

### Compilation and Execution

1. Copy the provided Java code into a file named `Main.java`.
2. Open your Java IDE or command line tool.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`.
4. Compile the program:
   - In the IDE: Use the built-in compile and run tools.
   - In the command line: Run `javac Main.java` to compile.
5. Run the compiled program:
